# Customer-shopping-behavior-Analysis-project
# Overview
This project analyzes shopping behavior for a retail company. The goal is to identify trends and give practical business recommendations. The work follows the CRISP DM framework. The project does not include predictive modeling. It focuses on data preparation, SQL analysis, and a Power BI dashboard.

# Business Question
How can the company use customer shopping data to identify trends, improve engagement, and optimize marketing and product strategies?

# Deliverables
- Python scripts for data cleaning and preparation.
- SQL scripts for business questions and insights.
- Power BI dashboard with key trends.
- Project report summarizing insights and recommendations.
- Presentation slides for stakeholders.

# CRISP DM Steps

# Business Understanding
The company wants to increase sales, build loyalty, and understand purchasing behavior. The analysis focuses on discount effects, product performance, customer segments, seasonality, channels, and payment preferences.

# Data Understanding
Exploration includes structure, missing values, duplicates, data types, and early patterns.
Key areas explored
- Customer demographics
- Product categories
- Transaction history
- Channels (online and offline)
- Seasonal trends
- Payment methods

# Data Preparation
- Performed using Python.
Main tasks
- Remove duplicates
- Fix missing values
- Standardize categories
- Create new fields such as total spend, frequency, recency, discount rate, season, and channel indicators
- Export clean tables for SQL and Power BI

# Data Analysis
- Performed using SQL.
- Main analysis areas
- Customer segments
- Loyalty indicators
- Purchase frequency
- Discount usage
- Seasonality trends
- Product performance
- Channel comparison
